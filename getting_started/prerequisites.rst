# Verified User Information

To access the interactive apps in the Disocvery Environment, we ask users to provide sufficient information about themselves in their user profiles to ensure proper use of the platform.

We ask users to provide a valid email address from an organization, i.e., `.org`, an educational institution with the `.edu` ending, or a government `.gov` -- we will not grant access to commercial email addresses, e.g., `@gmail.com` `@yahoo.com` `@msn.com` etc.

We also ask that users provide their |ORCID| -- ORCID is the most widely adopted digital identifier for research in the world.
