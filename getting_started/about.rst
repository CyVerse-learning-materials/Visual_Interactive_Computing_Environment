**About**
---------

**VICE** stands for **V**\isual **I**\nteractive **C**\omputing **E**\nvironment and is a part of CyVerse `Discovery Environment (DE) <https://de.cyverse.org>`_. 

**VICE** allows verified CyVerse users to launch customized containers of their favorite data science platforms.  

What is the big idea?
=====================

The DE supports executable applications which run as workflows on high performance or high throughput computing environments. 
**VICE** introduces Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) and common Integrated Development Environments (IDE) such as `Project Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_, `RStudio <https://www.rstudio.com/>`_, & Remote Desktops to the DE.

.. Note :: How is VICE different from other DE apps? 
    
    Applications or "Apps" in the DE are classified as: 
    
    * **executable** - meaning the user selects parameters and data for a particular analysis, and submits the job for execution (`HTCondor <https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/>`_ , `Tapis <https://tapis-project.org/>`_, `OSG <https://opensciencegrid.org/>`_). 
    * **HPC** - executable apps which run on `Texas Advanced Computing Center Tapis <https://tapis-project.org/>`_ as high performance computing (HPC) jobs.
    * **OSG** - executable apps which run on the `OpenScienceGrid <https://opensciencegrid.org/>`_ as high throughput (HTC) jobs.
    * **VICE** - interactive, visual computing environments with GUI or IDE.
