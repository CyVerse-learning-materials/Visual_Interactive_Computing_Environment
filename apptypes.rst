**Applications**
----------------

Currently VICE apps can be categorized broadly into three different types: Jupyter Notebooks/Lab, Rstudio and Rshiny. 

.. Note::

	In future there will support for many different types of VICE apps.

Each of these apps will serve different purposes. If you are interested in doing python/R/Julia based exploratory data analysis or visualization, you can use Jupyter Notebook/Lab app, whereas if you are interested in doing R-based exploratory data analysis or visualization you will use Rstudio VICE app. Finally Rshiny apps are good for interactive data analysis in R.

What is Jupyter Notebook?
=========================

The `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (formerly IPython Notebook) is Project Jupyter's flagship project for creating reproducible computational narratives. It enables users to create and share documents that combine live code with narrative text, mathematical equations, visualizations, interactive controls, and other rich output. It also provides building blocks for interactive computing with data: a file browser, terminals, and a text editor Notebook documents (or “notebooks”) are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code (e.g. python, r, julia) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, comments, images, links, etc…). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, images, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis. Jupyter Notebooks become a popular tool for teaching and conducting data science. They are the backbone for a number of commercial data science projects and other research projects as well. The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet. In addition to displaying/editing/running notebook documents, the Jupyter Notebook App has a “Dashboard” (Notebook Dashboard), a “control panel” showing local files and allowing to open notebook documents or shutting down their kernels.

What is the Jupyter Lab?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JupyterLab is an interactive development environment for working with notebooks, code and data. Most importantly, JupyterLab has full support for Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, JupyterLab enables you to use text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other custom components side by side with notebooks in a tabbed work area. JupyterLab provides a high level of integration between notebooks, documents, and activities:

- Drag-and-drop to reorder notebook cells and copy them between notebooks.
- Run code blocks interactively from text files (.py, .R, .md, .tex, etc.).
- Link a code console to a notebook kernel to explore code interactively without cluttering up the notebook with temporary scratch work.
- Edit popular file formats with live preview, such as Markdown, JSON, CSV, Vega, VegaLite, and more.

JupyterLab has been over three years in the making, with over 11,000 commits and 2,000 releases of npm and Python packages. Over 100 contributors from the broader community have helped build JupyterLab in addition to our core JupyterLab developers.

Rstudio
=======

RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. Some of its features include:

- Customizable workbench with all of the tools required to work with R in one place (console, source, plots, workspace, help, history, etc.).
- Syntax highlighting editor with code completion.
- Execute code directly from the source editor (line, selection, or file).
- Full support for authoring Sweave and TeX documents.
- Runs on all major platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and can also be run as a server, enabling multiple users to access the RStudio IDE using a web browser.

Shiny
======

Shiny is an open source R package that provides an elegant and powerful web framework for building web applications using R. Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge. Some of it's features include:

- Build useful web applications with only a few lines of code—no JavaScript required.
- Shiny applications are automatically “live” in the same way that spreadsheets are live. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs, without requiring a reload of the browser.
- Shiny user interfaces can be built entirely using R, or can be written directly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for more flexibility.
- Works in any R environment (Console R, Rgui for Windows or Mac, ESS, StatET, RStudio, etc.)
- Attractive default UI theme based on Twitter Bootstrap.
- A highly customizable slider widget with built-in support for animation.
- Pre-built output widgets for displaying plots, tables, and printed output of R objects.
- Fast bidirectional communication between the web browser and R using the websockets package.
- Uses a reactive programming model that eliminates messy event handling code, so you can focus on the code that really matters.
- Develop and redistribute your own Shiny widgets that other developers can easily drop into their own applications (coming soon!
