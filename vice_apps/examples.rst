Blessed Apps
-------------

CyVerse provides the base images of its containers on the DockerHub: https://hub.cyverse.org/r/cyversevice

And the recipe Dockerfiles of its featured (blessed :shield:) apps: https://github.com/cyverse-vice/


Instant Launches
----------------

From the Home tab on the Discovery Environment there are several blessed :shield: apps that have an **Instant Launch** feature which allows you to start the app without adding data in a single click.

These apps will launch with their default number of cores, amount of RAM, and timeout.

Quick Launches
--------------

Any public app can have a URL generated for it which takes the user directly to the app launcher, allowing the user to select their input data sets, and to set their size and time parameters. These **Quick Launches** of our featured apps are listed below in the table:
