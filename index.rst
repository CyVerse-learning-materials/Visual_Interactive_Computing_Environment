VICE Documentation
==================

The Visual and Interactive Computing Environment (VICE) is the latest feature in CyVerse's Discovery Environment (DE) for running interactive applications. 

This User Guide instructs users on basic functions of the DE: (a) how to launch an interactive app, (b) bring your data into the container, (c) run an analysis, and (d) save or upload your results to the cloud.

The Developer Guide gives advanced tips about how to (a) build your own VICE-ready containers, (b) host them on a public registry, and (c) integrate them into VICE and make them available to your user community.

Last, we provide a brief list of featured VICE apps in the DE.
